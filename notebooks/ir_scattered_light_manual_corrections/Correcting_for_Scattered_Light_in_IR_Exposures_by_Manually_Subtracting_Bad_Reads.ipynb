    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents one of two available methods to correct for a time variable background (TVB) due to scattered light from observing close to the Earth's limb. This method illustrates how to manually subtract any bad reads from the final exposure read of the WFC3/IR IMA data. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute and plot the difference between IMA reads to identify those affected by TVB. \n",
    "- Correct a single exposure in which the first few reads are affected by scattered light by subtracting those \"bad\" reads from the final IMA read.\n",
    "- Compare the original FLT to the reprocessed FLT image.\n",
    "- Compare the original DRZ to the reprocessed DRZ image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second method for correcting TVB (masking bad reads in the RAW image and re-running `calwf3`) can be found in the notebook [Correcting for Scattered Light in WFC3/IR Exposures: Using `calwf3` to Mask Bad Reads (O'Connor 2023)](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library/tree/master/notebooks/ir_scattered_light_calwf3_corrections). This method performs the 'ramp \n",
    "fitting' step in calwf3 and therefore removes cosmic rays from the final image. It only works, \n",

    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "WFC3 images can be affected by many different kinds of unwanted, non-science features,  such as satellite trails, peculiar cosmic rays, Earth-limb scattered light,  reflections off the filter wheel, and more. We call these features \"anomalies\". The majority of these anomalies are well studied, correctable, and easily identifiable, as discussed in  [WFC3 ISR 2017-22](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2017/WFC3-2017-22.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through the process of correcting WFC3/IR images for anomalies that appear in only some of the reads (see [section 7.7 of the WFC3 Instrument Handboook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3ihb/chapter-7-ir-imaging-with-wfc3/7-7-ir-exposure-and-readout) for a discussion of the WFC3/IR MULTIACCUM observing mode).  We examine \n",
    "an observation affected by a strong TVB due to Earth limb scattered light affecting the first few reads ([section 7.10 of the WFC3 Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-7-wfc3-ir-sources-of-error/7-10-time-variable-background)). We will manually subtract the affected reads from the final read of the IMA and copy the updated science and error arrays into the FLT science and error arrays.  This method is based on section 5 of  [WFC3 ISR 2016-16: 'Excising Individual Reads'](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2016/WFC3-2016-16.pdf).  This same method can be used to remove individual reads that contain other anomalies, such as satellite trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new FLT will have a reduced total exposure time (and signal-to-noise) given the rejection \n",
    "of some number of reads but will now have a flat background and an improved ramp fit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the notebook [WFC3/IR IMA Visualization with An Example of Time Variable Background (O'Connor 2023)](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library/tree/master/notebooks/ir_ima_visualization) for a walkthrough of how to identify a TVB due to scattered light. "
