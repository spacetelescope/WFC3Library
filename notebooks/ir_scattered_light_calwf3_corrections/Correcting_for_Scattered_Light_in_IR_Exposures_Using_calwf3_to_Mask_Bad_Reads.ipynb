    "# Correcting for Scattered Light in WFC3/IR Exposures: Using `calwf3` to Mask Bad Reads\n",

    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows one of two available methods to correct for time-variable background \n",
    "(TVB) due to scattered light from observing close to the Earth's limb. This method illustrates how to mask bad reads in the RAW image and then reprocess with `calwf3`, and it may be used for rejecting anomalous reads occurring either at the beginning or at the end of an exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute and plot the difference between IMA reads to identify the reads affected by TVB. \n",
    "- Reprocess a single exposure with `calwf3` by excluding the first few reads which are affected by scattered light.\n",
    "- Compare the original FLT to the reprocessed FLT image.\n",
    "- Compare the original DRZ to the reprocessed DRZ image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second method (manually subtracting bad reads from the final IMA read) can \n",
    "be found in the notebook [Correcting for Scattered Light in WFC3/IR Exposures: Manually Subtracting Bad Reads (O'Connor 2023)](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library/tree/master/notebooks/ir_scattered_light_manual_corrections). This provides a method for removing anomalies such as satellite trails which appear in the middle of an IMA exposure.  One caveat of the second method is that it does not perform the 'ramp fitting' step and therefore the calibrated FLT products will still contain cosmic rays.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that this method may leave large sky residuals in regions \n",
    "corresponding to WFC3/IR 'blobs', flagged in the FLT data quality (DQ) array as a value of 512. This method is therefore recommended for observations acquired using an WFC3-IR-DITHER-BLOB dither (or POSTARG equivalent) to step over blob regions. Software such\n",
    "as AstroDrizzle may then be used to combine the FLT exposures, while excluding pixels \n",

    "Observations with strong time variability in the sky background during a MULTIACCUM ramp can corrupt the WFC3 `calwf3` 'linear ramp fit' and cosmic-ray identification algorithm (CRCORR, [Section 3.3.10 of the Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-3-wfc3-data-calibration/3-3-ir-data-calibration-steps#id-3.3IRDataCalibrationSteps-3.3.10)). The CRCORR \n",
    "algorithm assumes that a given pixel sees a constant count rate throughout the read from a \n",
    "combination of sources and diffuse background (i.e., the integrated signal \"ramps\" are linear). A background \n",
    "varying strongly with time (i.e. where the \"ramps\" are non-linear) can trigger the cosmic-ray \n",
    "(CR) flagging thresholds in `calwf3`, causing the algorithm to identify most or all of the pixels as a CR at any given read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will examine an observation affected by strong TVB, \n",

We will run `calwf3` while rejecting the affected reads to create an improved FLT product with a flat background and an improved ramp fit. One caveat is that the new FLT will \n",

    "This new image was produced by `calwf3` after masking the first 5 reads (not including the zero read) in the RAW file, reducing the effective exposure time from 1403 to 1000 seconds. While the total exposure is reduced from 1403 seconds to 1000 seconds (thus decreasing the overall S/N of the image), the background in the reprocessed image is now uniform over the entire field of view. We can see that the new FLT image is free of the Earth limb scattered light visible in the old FLT image. \n",
